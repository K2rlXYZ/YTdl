A youtube ripper with a goofy ahh UI that i made. It's kinda finicky and moody.

Need to download ffmpeg from 
https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases 
and put it into ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\bin\Debug

It would be smart to make a shortcut to ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\bin\Debug\YTv2.exe
If you have windows you can just right click on it and there should be an option to create a shorcut for the executable.
