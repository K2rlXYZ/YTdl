A youtube ripper with a goofy ahh UI that i made. It's kinda finicky and moody.

ffmpeg needs to be downloaded from 
https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases 
and put into ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\bin\Debug

Executable is at ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\bin\Debug\YTv2.exe
It would be smart to make a shortcut to it for repeat use. If you have windows you can just right click on it and there should be an option to create a shorcut for the executable.

All the code that was written by me is in ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\MainWindow.xaml.cs
