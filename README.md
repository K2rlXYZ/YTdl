A youtube ripper with a goofy ahh UI that i made. It's kinda finicky and moody.

[ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip) needs to be downloaded and put into ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\bin\Debug
The version i use is 4.3.2 but i couldn't find any build for it.

Executable is at ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\bin\Debug\YTv2.exe
It would be smart to make a shortcut to it for repeat use. If you have windows you can just right click on it and there should be an option to create a shorcut for the executable.

All the code that was written by me is in ...\YTdlGIT\YTv2\MainWindow.xaml.cs

When waiting for search results depending on the amount of results wanted it can take some time so be patient ðŸ˜…
